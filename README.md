# Store Analysis System

## Project Overview
The Store Analysis System is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help store owners understand their sales. It analyzes transaction data to show sales trends, customer buying habits, and product performance. With this system, businesses can make smarter decisions to improve inventory, increase sales, and better serve customers. The system provides clear reports on sales performance, customer demographics, and the best and worst-selling products. It also includes charts to make trends easier to see. Users can also manage their records by adding, updating, or deleting transactions.
